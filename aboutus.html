      <h2>About Us - SocialFit</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the story of SocialFit, your favorite fitness social network!</p>
      <p>SocialFit was founded by Hadas Spier and Roee Sagi in April 2016 with a passion for fitness and a vision to create a community of fitness enthusiasts. Together, they built a platform that allowed people to share their workout routines, diet tips, and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>
      <p>However, in a surprising turn of events, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the tech mogul Elon Musk acquired SocialFit and decided to rebrand it as "Y." The platform underwent significant changes under Elon's ownership, and it became known for its innovative features and global reach.</p>
      <p>But the story doesn't end there! Hadas and Roee never lost their love for SocialFit. With a stroke of luck and a successful venture in the form of a random lemonade stand, they managed to buy back their shares in the company. With renewed passion and determination, they decided to revert the platform's name back to its roots - SocialFit.</p>
      <p>Today, SocialFit continues to thrive as the go-to social network for fitness enthusiasts worldwide. We're here to empower you on your fitness journey and provide a supportive community to help you achieve your health and wellness goals.</p>
      <p>Thank you for being part of the SocialFit family!</p>
